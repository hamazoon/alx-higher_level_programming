## Introduction

In Python, modules are files containing Python code that can define functions, classes, and variables. Modules help keep the code clean, organized, and reusable. This project introduces:
- Importing and using modules.
- Working with built-in Python modules.
- Writing your own Python modules.
- Using `__name__` and `__main__`.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing these tasks, you will:
- Understand the concept of modules in Python.
- Learn how to import functions, variables, and modules.
- Use built-in modules like `sys`, `math`, and more.
- Write scripts that use `command-line arguments`.

## Project Structure

This directory includes the following files:

- **`0-add.py`**: Imports a function from a file and performs addition.
- **`1-calculation.py`**: Imports and uses a custom calculator module.
- **`2-args.py`**: Prints the number and list of command-line arguments.
- **`3-infinite_add.py`**: Adds all command-line arguments.
- **`4-hidden_discovery.py`**: Lists all names defined in a hidden module.
- **`5-variable_load.py`**: Imports and prints a variable from another file.

## Tasks

1. **Import a function from a file**  
   Demonstrate importing and using a function to perform basic operations.

2. **Calculator program**  
   Use custom modules to perform multiple arithmetic operations.

3. **Command-line arguments**  
   Write a script that handles and displays arguments passed to it.

4. **Infinite addition**  
   Sum all integers provided as command-line arguments.

5. **Discover hidden names**  
   List all names defined in a module, including hidden ones.

6. **Load a variable**  
   Import and print a variable from a module.

## Usage

1. Run any script using Python 3:
   ```bash
   python3 <script_name>.py <arguments>
