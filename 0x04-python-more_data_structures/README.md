## Introduction

Sets and dictionaries are versatile and powerful data structures in Python. Sets are collections of unique elements, ideal for membership testing and removing duplicates. Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs, allowing for efficient retrieval and manipulation. This project explores:
- Set and dictionary operations.
- Advanced usage of comprehension.
- Integration of these structures with Python's built-in functions.

## Learning Objectives

By completing these tasks, you will:
- Understand the properties and operations of sets and dictionaries.
- Perform advanced manipulations using comprehension syntax.
- Work with lambda functions and map/reduce/filter for functional programming.
- Solve problems efficiently using these structures.
