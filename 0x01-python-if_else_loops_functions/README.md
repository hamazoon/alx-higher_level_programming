## Introduction

The projects in this directory focus on building foundational skills in Python programming. Topics covered include:
- Writing conditional statements using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
- Implementing loops such as `for` and `while`.
- Creating functions and understanding their scope.
- Utilizing the Python standard library for problem-solving.

## Learning Objectives

By completing these tasks, you will:
- Understand and use conditional statements effectively.
- Write loops to iterate over data.
- Define and use functions to make your code modular and reusable.
- Use Python's built-in functions and modules.

- **`2-print_alphabet.py`**: Prints the alphabet in lowercase.
- **`3-print_alphabt.py`**: Prints the alphabet, omitting `q` and `e`.
- **`4-print_hexa.py`**: Prints numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal.
- **`5-print_comb2.py`**: Prints numbers from 0 to 99, separated by commas.
- **`6-print_comb3.py`**: Prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
- **`7-islower.py`**: Checks for lowercase characters.
- **`8-uppercase.py`**: Converts a string to uppercase.
- **`9-print_last_digit.py`**: Prints the last digit of a number.
- **`10-add.py`**: Adds two integers and returns the result.
- **`11-pow.py`**: Computes a to the power of b.
- **`12-fizzbuzz.py`**: Implements the FizzBuzz logic.
