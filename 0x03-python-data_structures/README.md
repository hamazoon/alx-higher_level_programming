## Introduction

Lists and tuples are core data structures in Python. This project explores:
- Creating, accessing, and modifying lists and tuples.
- Performing operations like slicing, iteration, and comprehension.
- Using built-in Python functions for common tasks with lists and tuples.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing these tasks, you will:
- Understand the properties and uses of lists and tuples.
- Learn how to manipulate data using slicing and indexing.
- Utilize list methods and functions like `len`, `append`, `pop`, etc.
- Write Python programs that handle data effectively using these structures.

## Project Structure

This directory includes the following files:

- **`0-print_list_integer.py`**: Prints all integers of a list.
- **`1-element_at.py`**: Retrieves an element from a list.
- **`2-replace_in_list.py`**: Replaces an element in a list.
- **`3-print_reversed_list_integer.py`**: Prints all integers of a list in reverse order.
- **`4-new_in_list.py`**: Replaces an element in a list without modifying the original.
- **`5-no_c.py`**: Removes all characters `c` and `C` from a string.
- **`6-print_matrix_integer.py`**: Prints a matrix of integers.
- **`7-add_tuple.py`**: Adds two tuples.
- **`8-multiple_returns.py`**: Returns the length and the first character of a string.
- **`9-max_integer.py`**: Finds the maximum integer in a list.
- **`10-divisible_by_2.py`**: Identifies all multiples of 2 in a list.
- **`11-delete_at.py`**: Deletes an item at a specific position in a list.
- **`12-switch.py`**: Switches the values of two variables.
- **`13-is_palindrome.c`**: Checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
- **`lists.h`**: Header file for the C program.

## Tasks

1. **Printing integers in a list**  
   Use a loop to print each integer in a list.

2. **Accessing list elements**  
   Write a function to retrieve an element by index.

3. **Replacing list elements**  
   Replace an item at a specific position in a list.

4. **Reversing a list**  
   Print a list in reverse without modifying the original list.

5. **String manipulation**  
   Create a function that removes specific characters from a string.

6. **Handling 2D arrays**  
   Print a matrix of integers row by row.

7. **Tuple operations**  
   Perform operations like addition on tuples.

8. **Working with strings**  
   Extract string properties like length and the first character.

9. **Finding maximum values**  
   Write a function to find the largest number in a list.

10. **Logical operations with lists**  
    Identify which items in a list meet specific conditions.

11. **List modifications**  
    Write a function to delete an item from a specific position.

12. **Variable swapping**  
    Swap two variables in one line of code.

13. **Advanced C programming**  
    Implement a function in C to check if a linked list is a palindrome.
