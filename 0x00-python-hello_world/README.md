## Introduction

This project serves as the starting point for learning Python programming. It introduces:
- Python basics, including print statements and working with strings.
- Using shell scripts to execute Python code.
- Introduction to `pycodestyle` for linting and maintaining code quality.

## Project Structure

The directory includes the following files:

- **`0-run`**: A shell script to run a Python script.
- **`1-run_inline`**: A shell script to execute Python code directly in the shell.
- **`2-print.py`**: A Python script that prints a specific string.
- **`3-print_number.py`**: Demonstrates printing numbers with formatted strings.
- **`4-print_float.py`**: Prints a float with specific formatting.
- **`5-print_string.py`**: Manipulates strings and performs slicing.
- **`6-concat.py`**: Concatenates two strings.
- **`7-edges.py`**: Performs string slicing.
- **`8-concat_edges.py`**: Creates a new string using specific slices.
- **`9-easter_egg.py`**: Prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters.
- **`10-check_cycle.c`**: A C program to check for a cycle in a singly linked list.
- **`lists.h`**: Header file for the C program.
