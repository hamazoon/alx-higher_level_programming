## Introduction

Exceptions are runtime errors that occur during program execution. Python provides a structured approach to handle these errors using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks. This project introduces:
- How to catch and handle exceptions.
- Raising exceptions intentionally.
- Writing functions that behave predictably under error conditions.

- Understand the importance of exception handling.
- Learn how to use `try` and `except` blocks to catch errors.
- Raise exceptions with custom error messages.
- Use `finally` for cleanup operations.
- Write code that handles common exceptions gracefully.
