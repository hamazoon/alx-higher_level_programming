# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

This directory contains projects that introduce the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, focusing on creating and manipulating classes and objects. These tasks help establish a strong foundation for understanding and using OOP concepts in Python programming.

## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that structures code around "objects," which encapsulate data and behaviors. Python is a fully object-oriented language, and this project covers:
- Creating classes and objects.
- Defining attributes and methods.
- Using special methods like `__init__` and `__str__`.
- Understanding encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism basics.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing these tasks, you will:
- Understand the syntax and purpose of classes and objects.
- Learn how to define and use instance and class attributes.
- Write methods to define the behavior of a class.
- Use getter and setter methods for controlled access to attributes.
- Work with special methods for customized behavior.

## Project Structure

This directory includes the following files:

- **`0-square.py`**: Defines an empty `Square` class.
- **`1-square.py`**: Defines a `Square` class with a private attribute `size`.
- **`2-square.py`**: Adds validation for the `size` attribute.
- **`3-square.py`**: Adds a method to calculate the area of the square.
- **`4-square.py`**: Adds getter and setter methods for `size`.
- **`5-square.py`**: Adds a method to print the square using `#`.
- **`6-square.py`**: Extends the class to handle position for printing the square.

## Tasks

1. **Empty Square**  
   Create an empty `Square` class.

2. **Square with size**  
   Define a `Square` class with a private attribute `size`.

3. **Size validation**  
   Add validation to ensure `size` is a positive integer.

4. **Calculate area**  
   Add a method to compute the area of the square.

5. **Printing squares**  
   Implement a method to print the square using the `#` character.

6. **Positioned square**  
   Enhance the class to handle the position of the square when printed.

## Usage

Run Python scripts using:
```bash
python3 <script_name>.py
